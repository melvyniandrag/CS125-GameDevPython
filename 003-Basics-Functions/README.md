# Python Basics part 2

## Scripts
Last week we used the REPL to write interactive Python programs.
Typically you will not do this. Typically you will write all of your commands into a file or a bunch of files, and then run the files.

Write a few scripts

Then run one of the pygame examples

## Functions
### Functions that give us values
Sometimes you want to do a bunch of things, but bundle all of things you are doing into a logic chunk. This is what functions are for. They are reusable and modular.

### Functions that don't return values
Last week we saw one of these. print(). print() doesnt give us anything, it just does something. 
Another function that does this is list.append()
