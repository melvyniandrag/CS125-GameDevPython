# Python Basics Part 1

## Data types
* string
* int 
* float

# Your first functions!

| function | what it does |
| --- | ---|
| `print()` | will print something out |
| `type()` | will tell you the type of something |

Try this!
```
>>> type(5)
# see the output
>>> type(4.3)
# see the output
>>>type("hello")
# see the output
>>> x = 1
>>> type(x)
# see the output
```

## Operators
| operator | what it does |
| --- | --- |
| `+` | adds |
| `-` | subtracts |
| `*` | multiplies  |
| `/` | divides |

Above I tell you what these operators do for numbers. You can also use + and * with strings
```
>>> "hello" + " " + "world"
#see the output
>>> "hello" * 3
# see the output
```

## variables




## Data structures
lists
tuples
sets
dictionaries
use type() to show the types of things

## Loops
for 
while

## Conditionals
if
